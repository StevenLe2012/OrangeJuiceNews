                            <p>Hello! My name is Ms. Pelagio and I teach US History. This is my 5th year teaching at Trevor Browne and 2nd in The Orange Juice. I love teaching American History because it is the story of how our country came to be. I have also enjoyed the past 2 years in newspaper because it‚Äôs allowed me to get to know students in my class outside of that environment.<br><br>Fun Fact: I am also a Trevor Browne graduate.</p>

                            <p>Hello! My name is Brian! :) First thing I would like to mention is that I‚Äôm a breed between white and Mexican so I guess you can say Whitexican? I love technology. I been thinking about inventions and thinking of ways to interact with technology itself. Today, I find myself knowing alottttt about technology with sometimes surprising myself with how much I know. I love anime, but I don‚Äôt watch too much of it, however, because I like to also stay very productive as I leave my day with a whole schedule put in place.</p>
							<p>I have been in Orange Juice News since December 2019. I am a Junior, and I became the President as I find myself to be able to easily help groups of people. I have helped in making this website with the help of Steven Le. We both know about coding so we have both contributed to making this website. I hope this website gets to go far because we put lots of determination into making it :D.</p>

							<p>Hey everyone! I‚Äôm Jenna, a senior at TGB :). If you can picture a Vietnamese girl that‚Äôs just over five feet and loves to get creative, then you would be picturing me! I love spending my free time painting, baking, or anything else that gets my gears turning. I dislike being bored haha. Other than my personal hobbies, I have played basketball since the 6th grade, and I‚Äôm even a part of TGB‚Äôs varsity basketball team. Although I have played basketball for so long, I would have to say that Badminton is my favorite sport even though I‚Äôve only played since sophomore year.  Since becoming the varsity captain of TGB‚Äôs badminton team during my junior year, I have led my team to two consecutive Metro Region Champions titles, and I am proud to be able to say that! I am an avid anime watcher if I do say so myself. Here are some of my anime-related achievements:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Watching every single episode of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/naruto"><i>Naruto</i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/naruto-shippuden"><i>Naruto Shippuden</i></a> without skipping any fillers.</li>
								<li>Being over halfway done with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece"><i>One Piece</i></a>.</li>
								<li>Being able to read subtitles and actually watch the anime simultaneously!</li>
							</ul>
							<p>My all-time favorite anime is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/haikyu"><i>Haikyu</i></a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter"><i>Hunter x Hunter</a></i> coming in at a close second. I love meeting new people, so if you‚Äôre reading this, and you see me in person, come talk to me! Hopefully, you‚Äôve learned enough about me in this short biography that can instigate some type of conversation :). Until we meet again, reader...</p>

                            <p>HEYYOO!!! I‚Äôm Steven Le! o/ ‚Üê (me waving). First thing I have to say is that I have no idea how to make bios‚Ä¶ SO LET'S WING IT!!! (^_^‚Äô) I am Vietnamese-American, and I have been gaming since I was 5; I LOVE gaming. The first game I ever played was <a target="_blank" href="https://maplestory.nexon.net/landing"><i>MapleStory</i></a>, and I still visit that game every once in a while haha (pls tell me someone here played Maple too ;-;). Fun Fact: My personal statement was about video games! Right now, I‚Äôm playing quite a bit of <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/"><i></i>League of Legends</i></a>. I‚Äôm also a big anime fan. My favorite shows are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/sword-art-online"><i>Sword Art Online</i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba"><i>Demon Slayer</i></a>. I even finished the whole <a target="_blank" href="https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba"><i>Demon Slayer</i> Manga.</a> Can‚Äôt wait till the movie comes out, so I can see it all animated!</p>
                            <p>Oh yeah, I should probably talk about the Orange Juice News and my contributions to the club lmao. So I've been in the Orange Juice News since sophomore year, and I am currently a senior. I became the treasurer my junior year of high school. During my 11th to 12th-grade summer, I took the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brandeis.edu/precollege/programs/app-design/index.html" >Brandeis App Design Pre-College</a> program, where I learned about HTML and coding. This is where I got the necessary skills to start making this website. I hope you enjoyed what I started and I'm praying this continues on after my graduation!</p>
                            <p>Haha, did I just successfully make a bio? (Õ°o‚ÄøOÕ°) If you want to talk and get to know each other better, hmu on insta <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stevenle1337/">@stevenle1337</a> or on Discord @BusterOfDoom#9038 because having new friends is always nice :D.</p>

                            <p>Hey, what‚Äôs up! I‚Äôm Jair Carrizal, and you‚Äôre watching Disney channel. The first thing I would like to say is that I am a mix of Mexican and Philipino. I always had a passion for music, which has made me the odd one out of my family at times. One of the first CDs I ever owned was Drake's <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6agmeioaDOBupymziJihgB?si=Rpi_2OUmRaKFrNOU23AXsw"><i>Thank Me Later</i> album</a>. Sometimes, I find myself writing lyrics randomly, and that's a gift that I just can't explain. I later fell in love with emo rap. One of my favorite artists is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Urban_(musician)">Sub Urban</a>. I'm also a big fan of <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening">Matt Groening's</a> shows <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons"><i>The Simpsons</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment_(TV_series)"><i>Disenchanted</i></a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama"><i>Futurama</i></a>. I have probably spent too much time watching all of those shows, but I love the animation in each show.

								I joined the Orange Juice News in September 2020, and I am a Junior. I originally joined because I liked writing, but things changed. I ended up being an illustrator... wait no an animator. Honestly, I don't know haha. I just draw stuff, so yeah! I ended up drawing the mascot, Ozzie, and I realized that I love drawing; So, now, I‚Äôm just working on more drawings and on a couple of articles! :D

                            <p>Hi! My name is Irais, and I‚Äôm a sophomore. I‚Äôve been in the Newspaper since the start of the 2020 school year. I joined because I thought I could try a different form of writing rather than the essays most students do for their English class. I never really liked writing essays, but it turns out that I enjoy writing when I have the ability to choose my topic. Anyway, a little bit about me is that I love listening to music, and I love exploring new genres and finding out what other people like to listen to. I feel you can really get to know a person by their music taste. I also enjoy being on my phone as anyone would, especially playing games like Roblox and Minecraft (I‚Äôm not quite the gamiest though). I also like watching TV shows and movies. Some of my favorites are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things">Stranger Things</a>,  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbad_(film)">Superbad</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Girls">Mean Girls</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Chicks">White Chicks</a>. Another thing about me is that I enjoy drawing and coloring. Although I‚Äôm not the best at drawing, I like to display what‚Äôs on my mind on paper. Well, there‚Äôs really not that much to me as a person, so that‚Äôs all I can think of lol. :)
